This is the repository for my final assignment of UBC's **Data Science Toolbox** course. <br>

#### Deliverable
A Jupyter Book created from scratch, hosted online using GitHub Pages.

#### Criteria
The Jupyter Book must contain these elements:
<br>
- 2 Markdown files
- 2 Jupyter Notebook files
They must be split over at least 2 parts in the table of contents
<br>
Each Markdown file must contain:
- 2 block math equations
- 2 code blocks
- 2 image files
- 2 admonitions
    - *I think this was meant for the Jupyter Book*
- 1 margin content
    - *Again, I think this is for the book, not the .md file*
    
<br>
Each Jupyter Notebook file must contain:<br>

- 5 markdown cells with at least:
    - 2 block math equations
    - 2 code blocks
    - 2 image files
- 5 executable code cells
- 2 plots generated using 2 additional *hidden* code cells

#### Formatting
The Jupyter Book must contain 5 citations and a bibliography.

#### Development
Use Git and GitHub to develop the Jupyter Book.
- make at least 10 commits
- create at least 1 branch and pull request for 1 or more content files
<br>

The final Jupyter Book needs to be readily available on GitHub Pages through a publicly accessible link.
